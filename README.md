To run the code, first clone the project. Next, open eclipse and import as an existing gradle project 
(the root directory should be the same directory where the project was cloned). Add mySQL jar into the build
path for all three folders, and once it is added, make sure the PORT_NUMBER variable in the
"DataBaseManager.java" is the same as your local computer. Run "DesktopLauncher.java"
